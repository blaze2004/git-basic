            <!--Write about solar enerygy-->
            Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving
            technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture,
            molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.
